# CodyTidyup

Quickly format and share snippets of your code.

## Why I Built This

As a software engineer who is also growing an audience, you may periodically share code snippets on Twitter, Reddit, or elsewhere. I found doing so to be quite tedious. Existing tools, like [ray.so](https://ray.so), allow you to add a cool gradient behind your code, but don't help when it comes to formatting the code itself.

CodeTidyup is the first code sharing tool that includes a customizable, automatic code formatter. It also includes helpful code sharing features such as layouts (e.g. before and after), backgrounds, and more. Give it a try the next time you want to share a code snippet online.

## Usage

1. Visit [codytidyup.com](https://codetidyup.com)
2. Paste code snippet into editor and press "Format"
3. Choose desired layout and color scheme
4. Export shareable image
